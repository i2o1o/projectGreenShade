<p>GRAND LEDGE, MI -- Grand Ledge City officials gather tonight to discuss placing official restrications against recreational rock climbing at Oak Park. The issue was raised when citizens noticed blocks of stone held on to the cliff wall by epoxy. </p>
<p>Grand Ledge Parks and Recreation official Joshua Lewis states "There are already signs that the condition of the area should be a topic of discussion. Local climbers have been using industrial strength epoxies to retain to attach loose stone back on the clidf wall. Michigan's extreme conditions can only add to the potential risks that climbers may face. We hope to protect our residents and tourists from unpredictable situations."</p>
<p>There are several community members who are attending this meeting to oppose any restrictions from being placed on rock climbing. Much of them part of Grand Ledge's rock climbing community. Among them, Daniel Heatherworth of Lansing.</p>
<p>"I've been climbing at Oak Park for nearly six years. Amoung that time, there have been no incidents and the level of safety has actually increased. In that time, we've also placed several secure rope chains and bolts that were not previously installed.</p>
<p>Some locals are also expressing concerns that such restrictions could harm the city's tourism economy. Local business owner Linda Briarwood owns the Lickity Split Ice Cream parlor located next to Oak Park."There are climbers coming as far as Indiana to climb these walls. It would be a devasting blow to local tourism. The park is a special place for many Michigan climbers. Recently, a man from Ann Arbor proposed to his girlfriend near the cliffs. He proposed near a local climb called 'Chips' and asked 'Emily Miller, I want you forever. Will you marry me?" </p>
