                             <p>GRAND LEDGE, MI -- Lansing man Cedric Hekmati, who has been coming to Grand Ledge since 2011, has submitted a letter to members of Grand Ledge City Concil asking them to refrain from passing policies restricting Oak Park vistors to from recreational rock climbimg.</p>
                              <p>"For nearly three and a half years, I have been coming to Oak Park and treated like family by Grand Ledges's climbing community. To enact policies to close the park for climbing would be a severe drawback for the city's tourism," Hekmati said in the letter.</p>
                              <p>This is not the first time Hekmati has dicatated letters to U.S. officials. He previously presented open letters to Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama.</p>
                              <p>"As a war veteran who defended our nation in its time of need, I ask that you also work to defend my dignity and that of my fellow Americans by putting in place serious consequences for this serial hostage-taking and mistreatment of Americans by Iran's Ministry of Intelligence for clearly illegal purposes."</p>
                              <p>The family also released a letter to Congress from Hekmati's sister, Sarah Hekmati.</p>
                              <p>"After three and a half years, clearly greater and additional action is needed," she wrote. "We would also respectfully ask all members to respect our family's desire that Amir's case not become a domestic U.S. partisan political football."</p>
                              <p>Hekmati was born in Arizona, but later moved to Flint while his father worked at Mott Community College. He graduated from high school in Flint before joining the U.S. Marine Corps in 2001.</p>
                              <p>In August 2011, Hekmati was arrested in Iran on allegations that he was a spy. Family members say he was making the trip to visit his grandmother in Tehran after getting permission from the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C.</p>
                              <p>Initially, he was sentenced to death. The sentence was overturned, and he was later charged with cooperating and collaborating with the U.S. government, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>

                              <p>GRAND LEDGE, MI -- Grand Ledge City officials gather tonight to discuss restrictions that may be placed on recreational rock climbing at one of the city's most destinations,  Oak Park. Parks officials are concerned over potential risks due the geology of the park. </p>
                              <p>"Sandstone has the potential to become very brittle much quicker than other geological formations. There are already signs that can be seen through out the cliff walls. Michigan's extreme conditions can only help to accellerate this process. We hope to protect our residents and tourists from unpredictable situations." says Grand Ledge Parks and Recreation official Joshua Lewis.</p>
                              <p>There are several community members who are attending this meeting to oppose any restrictions from being placed on rock climbing. Much of them part of Grand Ledge's rock climbing community. Among them, Daniel Heatherworth of Lansing.</p>
                              <p>"I've been climbing at Oak Park for nearly six years. Amoung that time, there have been no incidents and the level of safety has only increased</p>
